# 1. What is PostgreSQL? 
## PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores and manages data. It supports SQL for querying and allows complex data operations with high reliability, scalability, and extensibility.
# 2. What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?
## A database schema is a way to organize and group database objects like tables, views, and functions. It helps keep the database structured and allows multiple users or applications to work with the same database without conflicts.

# 3. Explain the Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts in PostgreSQL.

Primary Key: A unique identifier for each row in a table. It ensures no duplicate rows and that every record can be uniquely identified.

Foreign Key: A field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, creating a link between the two tables and ensuring referential integrity.
